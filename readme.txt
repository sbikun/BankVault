## Overview

BankVault is an offline personal finance tracking tool that can be used to 
track different kinds of expenses over time. Users can parse .csv files from
different banking institutions to provide their own classifications. Expenses
can be marked as part of a monthly budget or a yearly budget. Regex's can be
saved to automatically classify transactions.

BankVault is made using Python and PyQt for UI. It was started in 2010 (or so)
as a way for me to learn Python.
